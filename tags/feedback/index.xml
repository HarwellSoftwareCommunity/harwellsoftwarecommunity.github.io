      <description>Do you have an idea for an event you&amp;rsquo;d like to see us run?
Or want to suggest some different topic you&amp;rsquo;d like to see covered in out talks and workshops?
We try to maintain a fairly even balance of talks, workshops, discussions, etc. covering a wide range of topics that are relevant to the work that happens on site, with that in mind we are very open to suggestions from the community to distribute knowledge and encourage collaboration as much as possible.</description>
